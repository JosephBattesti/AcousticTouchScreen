# AcousticTouchScreen

We had the assignment of creating a Touch sensitive surface out of any material. Using a contact mic (piezo), it is possible to recognize where a finger has touched the surface
by recognizing de impulse response associated with the touched location. It was possible to creat a grid of 8 distinct spots on the surface and trigger a different piano note when touching
